		<img class="type1" src="images/boxing_1.png">
		<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Recreational Boxers.</span>To get to know our users better, we went to boxing gyms in the area and talked to boxers and trainers. We observed some boxers training.</figcaption>
		<p>The first step in the process was to get to know the users. This involved going on trips to boxing gyms and meeting users in their environment. We listened to stories, observed their daily routine, and tried to determine their guiding values and beliefs. We recorded all this information through pictures and careful notetaking.</p>
		<img class="type1" src="images/boxing_2.png">
		<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Personas.</span>One of the results of our user visits were personas. The three personas we developed were iterated on multiple times, and gave us a consise way to think about our users. We used the personas throughout our design process to connect our product back to our users.</figcaption>
		<p>After many discussions on insights gained from our user visits, we developed personas and areas of opportunity. These frameworks also helped us get deeper into why our users did the things they did, something we had trouble with initially.</p>
		<h5>Idea Generation and Co-Designing</h5>
		<p>Using our areas of opportunity and personas, we came up with as many ideas as we could. These ideas covered a range of feasibility, and looked to help recreational boxers in many different aspects of their lives. </p>
		<img class="type1" src="images/boxing_3.jpg">
		<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Progression of Ideas Framework. </span>This framework helped us visualize and keep track of how our ideas were changing as we progressed in the design process. While we started with about 20 ideas, many of them were eventually killed, or combined with other ideas. It presents a good idea of how exactly our ideas evolved.</figcaption>
		<p>From there, we took some of these basic concepts to our users for their help in shaping them. As you can see above, the progression of our ideas wasn’t very linear. Some ideas would be combined, or altered based on our codesigns.</p>

		<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Codesigning and Gallery Sketches.</span>The first image is from one of the codesigns we did with our users. We took many of our initial ideas, and tried to get initial yes/no feedback through index cards. We then went deeped into each of the ideas and tried to get a sense of what the user thought each idea entailed. The second image 9 gallery sketches of our most promising ideas. The top three ideas are at the bottom. These ideas were shaped from codesigns, personas, user needs and values, and all of our design work up to this point. </figcaption>
		<p>Codesigning with props were a challenge for our team, because we found it hard to push our users to imagine our sketch models as final products. While we did use props in our codesign, we also got a lot of feedback through various other methods.</p>
		<p>Finally, we were left with 3 ideas that we thought could make the most impact in our users’ lives.</p>
		<h5>Developing the Product into a Concept</h5>
		<p>To develop the concept, we had to think specifically about how the user would interact with our product. To do this, we used a variety of frameworks. One of the more useful frameworks was the Function, Interaction, Character framework. It helped us organize our thoughts on how the various parts of the product would work together.</p>
		<img class="type1" src="images/boxing_6.png">
		<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Function Interaction Character (FIC). </span> We took the chosen idea, and broke it up into four unique parts. To start developing the product, we first determined the function, interaction and character. Doing this gave us a starting point to further shape the product to make sense based on what recreational boxers value. </figcaption>
		<p>To begin testing interactions, we also began to build sketch models. Making real, physical things allowed us to really test some of the interactions we were thinking about. The sketch models also allowed us to communicate iteractions within our team more easily.</p>
		<img class="type1" src="images/boxing_7.png">
		<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Sketch Modeling</span> We began to shape the product by creating simple sketch models. These models had different purposes. Some were used to show the functionality, while others looked at the type of interface. We used the models to figure out where to put buttons, and helped us think through the entire product.</figcaption>
		<h5>Final Product</h5>
		<img class="type1" src="images/boxing_8.png">
		<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Final Models</span>Left is a simple model for a tv sized display that would be available at a boxer's gym, which would display their data from the past bouts, to help them practice safer boxing technique. On the right is a model for a simple wristband that the referrees would be given.</figcaption>
		<p>End result was a product called FightSafe, which puts force sensors into a boxers helmet. The referee of matches gets notified discretely when boxer is about to undergo irreparable head damage, and calls a technical knockout (which already exists) Boxers have access to the data collected in bouts at their local gyms, to encourage safer fighting techniques. </p>
