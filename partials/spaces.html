<h5>The Process</h5>
<p>This project had two main phases: a design phase, and a prototyping/building phase. Each phase had its own guiding principles. The process used in the project helped us figure out what to build and how to improve the space. </p>

<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Process Diagram. </span> Our process to find problems and solutions for the space is illustrated above. This process helped us systematically understand our users, understant the culture surrounding the class, and discover problems within the space. </figcaption>
<p>In the first design phase, we used a process to get from people to problems. One of the biggest focuses in this process was the properties of the space. The properties of the space are directly tied to the attitudes, values and actions of the students in the class. The goal of this design process was to capture the culture of the class and represent in the space. We were also trying to nudge the culture of the class in a slightly different direction.</p>
<img class='type1' src="images/spaces_2.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Prototyping Cycle. </span> While prototyping, we used this cycle to quickly identify whether ideas were worth pursuing or not. Through each iteration, we evaluated the prototype to determine whether or not to continue pursuing the idea. This kept us from wasting time building polished prototypes that aren't a good fit for the space. </figcaption>
<p>Once we determined the problems and solutions within the space, we had to develop these solutions to ensure that they would have the desired effect. To do this, we used a prototyping cycle. We immediately started building things, to various levels of finish, and testing them with other students and professor. By understanding their reactions to our prototypes, we were able to make changes, or abandon ideas entirely. This cycle saved us from wasting time pursuing ideas that wouldn't fit into the overall vision of the space, and helped us narrow down to a few ideas that could make a big impact on the space.</p>
<h5>The Design Template</h5>
<p>We began our design process by first learning as much as we could about our users. We talked to Olin students to determine what people liked about the class and what they didn't. Some key things we found were: Principles of Engineering gave people the opportunity to fail, allowed you to make something for yourself, and was a black hole for things. We organized these insights and used them to find cultural values, and attitudes exisiting in the space. </p>
<img class='type1' src="images/spaces_3.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>User Insights. </span>The key insights that we found from our discussions with faculty and students about the Principles of Engineering class and space are illustrated in the poster above. These big user insights shaped our view of the users, and gave us guidance through the rest of the process. </figcaption>
<p>The next step was to take these insights and turn them into properties of the space. To do this, we used a framework called the Design Template. We connected attitudes, which we found from the user insights, to actions that students and professors would do in the space. The actions are then connected to properties of the space. The properties, such as density, give us direction on how to craft our solutions for the space. For example, a sparse space might have more whiteboard, to encorage the users to craft the space to their needs.</p>

<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>The Design Template. </span> This framework is adapted from the Stanford D-School, and helped us connect the users to the properties of the space.Attitudes are the cultural values and habits of the people in the space. Actions are what people do in the space, and Properties are the specific aspects of the space. </figcaption>
<h5>Idea Generation</h5>
<img class="type1" src="images/spaces_5.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Needs and Solutions. </span>This framework identified the 10 key needs of the space, and proposed solutions based on the properties of the space. These solutions were then explored further</figcaption>
<p>The next step was the generate as many ideas as possible to improve the space. After identifying 10 basic needs of the space, we came up with about 500 different ideas to solve these problems. We came up with some ideas that were crazy, and others that were extremely simple. These ideas were all sketched, to start thinking about how to implement or build the ideas.</p>
<img class="type1" src="images/spaces_6.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Sketches. </span>We explored some of our proposed solutions through sketches. Some solutions were more far-fetched than others, but we still sketched them to see whether we could implement some variant of the initial idea.</figcaption>
<h5>Prototyping</h5>
<p>One of the ideas that I worked on was an undertable storage system to store project parts, and team tools under the work tables. I had to work with the existing tables to design shelving that could be flexible enough to fit all teams' needs, while still providing the structure to keep the space from turning into a mess. Below are all the iterations of undertable storage, until the deployed prototype. Read the captions for more information on each iteration.</p>
<img class="type1" src="images/spaces_7.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Iteration 1. </span>This first iteration just explored whether putting cabinets under the tables would even be feasible. By sitting at tables with carboard in the place where cabinets were, we could test to see whether the storage cabinets would make it uncomfortable to sit at the table. We found that you do have enough legroom. </figcaption>
<img class="type1" src="images/spaces_8.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Iteration 2. </span>This carboard prototype explored what size the storage cabinet would be, and what type of shelving to provide. The initial idea was to store students' toolboxes under the tables. However, based on feedback we got, we decided instead to put shelving to store teams' project materials. The cardboard prototype allowed us to figure this out early, and make the apporopriate changes.</figcaption>
<img class="type1" src="images/spaces_9.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Iteration 3. </span>The durable prototype started looking at the physical design of the storage cabinet. In this first prototype, we learned whether the long shelf could hold the weight of a toolbox, and whether the yellow bin cubbies were big enough (they weren't). From a fabrication standpoint, this prototype was handmade, meaning all the pieces were cut by hand. Doing this version by hand let me figure out quickly what problems I was going to have in assembly. </figcaption>
<img class="type1" src="images/spaces_10.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Iteration 4. </span>This final deployed protoype was CNC cut, with a nicer grade plywood. This prototype was a culmination of about 10 weeks of work, and was only sucessful due to the things I learned from the previous three prototypes. This protoype has yet to be tested, as the next semester has not yet started. We should learn more from this prototype, and then make changes again, and deploy another prototype. </figcaption>
