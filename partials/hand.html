<h5>Design Goals and Constraints</h5>
<p>Our teams design goals for this project were to have a hand that could pick up different sized items, for example a ping pong ball and a basketball, be able to pick up irregularly shaped objects, like a water bottle, have a parametric finger orientation, and be powered by one motor. Each prototype had different material restrictions. The first prototype was made entirely of laser cut plywood, delrin and water jet sheetmetal. The second prototype was built with only 3D-printed PLA. Finally, the third prototype was built with a combination of all materials, with an extra $25 worth of special hardware.</p>
<h5>Prototype 1: Plywood, Delrin, and Sheet Metal</h5>
<p>For the first prototype, we were given plywood, delrin and sheetmetal. The basis of our initial design was plywood, and we used very little sheetmetal. The key features of this design were: three fingers actuated by cable, planetary gear transmission, rotatable fingers, and springs to keep the fingers open. </p>

<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Prototype 1. </span> Left is the fully assembled first prototype. The finger design sucessfully reduced the friction of the cable rubbing against other parts. On the right is the CAD for the first prototype. One challenge we had was integrating all the various sub-assemblies that each person was in charge of into a single assembly. </figcaption>
<p>On this prototype, I was specifically in charge of the finger design. While the fingers did bend, we reached stall on the motor before the fingers could bend all the way. Essentially, the design had the cable that actuated the fingers closer to the pivot point than the springs were. This created a situation where the moment applied by the spring about the pivot point was much higher than the moment applied by the cable.</p>

<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Finger Assembly Drawing. </span> The drawing shows how to fingers were assembled. Each finger section was constructed using finger joints to create a box structure. Each subsequent finger is smaller in width, and fits within each other.</figcaption>
<h5>Prototype 2: 3D Printed PLA</h5>
<p>On the second prototype, we were only given 3D-Printed PLA. Based on some of the problems we had in the first prototype, we made a few design changes. While our fingers were still cable driven, we moved to a polymer based joints. This eliminated the need for springs, because the polymer joints acted as springs. We also moved away from a planetary gear transmission, and instead went to a threaded rod transmission. </p>

<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Prototype 2. </span> Right is the CAD of our 3D-Printed mechanical hand. Each finger was to have Urethane rubber embedded inside of it, to allow it to bend. On the left is the final working transmission, which used a threaded rod pulling a cable instead of a planetary gear system.</figcaption>
<p>Again on this prototype, we ran into problems with the fingers. Specifically in the polymer based joints. The polymer we used was too weak, and could not keep the finger upright. In addition, the weak polymer allowed the fingers to twist, preventing the hand from being able to pick up anything</p>

<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Prototype 2 Assembly Drawing </span> This drawing shows all the unique parts in our second iteration design. Because we were using 3D-Printed material, we could design more complex geometries into a single part. This allowed us to reduce the complexity in fabrication, by increasing the complexity of each individual part.</figcaption>
<h5>Prototype 3: Any Fabrication</h5>
<p>Prototype 3 was limited in total amount of material: 100 grams of 3D-printed PLA, 18”x18” total surface area of planar material (⅛” plywood, ⅛” Delrin, 0.05” 5052 aluminum sheet metal), and $25 of parts from McMaster-Carr.  We stuck with the same essential design as prototype 2, but changed some of the materials, and improved our fabrication methods. </p>
<img class="type1" src="images/hands_5.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Prototype 3. </span>On the right is the CAD for our final design. We used what we learned from the past iterations to finally create a working hand. We still 3D-printed any parts that needed complex geometries, but switched some parts back into planar manufacturing methods, due to material restrictions. On the left is the final, fabricated hand. For this iteration, the asthetics of the hand were taken into consideration, and we tried to follow a color scheme for the entire hand.</figcaption>
<p>The fingers in this prototype worked as expected. We ran a small test to ensure that our polymer joints would be strong enough, which gave us the confidence we needed that our fingers would work. Some changes we made to reduce the twisting of the fingers were shark fins on each finger joint that fit into the other finger joint as it closes.</p>

<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Close up on the fingers. </span> In this picture, you can see where the cable runs, the improved geometry of each finger joint, and the addition of the shark fins, to improve rigidity. This finger design proved sucessful.</figcaption>
<p>For this final prototype, I was in charge of the transmission. While the design was the same, I moved to an real lead screw, instead of a 3D-printed one, and interfaced it with the same 3D printed gears.</p>
<img class="type1" src="images/hands_7.png">
<figcaption><i class="fa fa-search"></i><span>Transmission Close-Up. </span> Right is the full transmission. The design is simple, and makes use of a combination of materials and special hardware. While not preferable, we decided to 3D-print our own gears because the hand would not be used rigourously over a long period of time. For our uses, 3D-printed gears would be easier, and would be easier to connect to our threaded rod. On the left is a closeup on the gears. The bottom gear is held in place in a divet with just friction. </figcaption>
